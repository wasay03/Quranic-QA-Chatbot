                "ground_truth": "The story of Adam (AS) in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:35-37) teaches valuable lessons about free will and repentance. According to Ibn Kathir's tafsir, when Allah commanded Adam and his wife to avoid the forbidden tree, He gave them the freedom to choose between obedience and disobedience (2:35). This demonstrates that humans have been endowed with free will, allowing them to make decisions that can lead to either righteousness or sin.\n\nHowever, when Adam and his wife disobeyed Allah's command, they immediately felt remorse and turned to Allah in repentance (2:37). This episode illustrates the importance of seeking forgiveness and repentance when one has erred. Allah's acceptance of their repentance (2:37) shows that He is Merciful and Forgiving, always willing to pardon those who turn to Him with a sincere heart.\n\nIn essence, the story of Adam (AS) in Surah Al-Baqarah emphasizes that humans have the capacity for free will, but also the opportunity to repent and seek forgiveness when they make mistakes. This narrative serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle between good and evil, and the need for constant vigilance and humility in the face of temptation.",

It talks about God appointing Adam as a vicegerent (representative) on Earth. The angels are concerned because they think humans might cause corruption, but God knows better. Adam is given knowledge and tools to fulfill his mission. There's mention of the test in Paradise where Adam and Eve are tempted by Satan, they eat the forbidden fruit, repent, and are forgiven. Their descent to Earth is part of their preparation for their role as vicegerents. The text also contrasts this with Christian views on original sin, stating that each person is responsible for their own sins, not Adam's.\n\nSo, the question is asking \"Who is Adam (A.S)?\" The answer should be based solely on the context provided.

He was tested in Paradise with Satan's temptation, leading to their expulsion to Earth.\n3. After repenting, God accepts his repentance, showing mercy.\n4. His role is part of a covenant with God, where humans must choose to follow guidance.\n5. He's the first human tasked with the mission, and his story sets the stage for the Islamic view of responsibility and free will.\n\nThe answer should mention his role as vicegerent, the test, repentance, and his covenant with God. Also, note that he's the first in a line (descendants) responsible for God's message. Avoid mentioning Christian doctrines unless contrasting, but the question is about Adam's identity per the context.\n\nWait, the user wants the answer based ONLY on the context. The context doesn't mention \"A.S.\" as a title, but in Islamic tradition, that's an honorific (peace be upon him). But since the context refers to him as Adam, I should stick to the text's terms. The answer should include his appointment as vicegerent, the test with Satan, repentance, and his role in the covenant. Also, his mission's purpose and how his story is part of the Quran's message in Al-Baqarah. Make sure not to include external info like other religious views unless the context does so. The context does contrast with Christian views but the answer should focus on what's stated here. So the answer should be a summary of these points.\n</think>\n\nAdam (A.S) is portrayed in the context as the first human appointed by God as a vicegerent (representative) on Earth. He was given knowledge and tools to fulfill his mission, along with his descendants, to act as stewards of God\u2019s message and carry out His will. His story includes a test in Paradise, where he and his spouse were tempted by Satan, leading to their expulsion to Earth. After repenting, God accepted his repentance, emphasizing mercy and the possibility of forgiveness. Adam\u2019s experience established the covenant between humanity and God, outlining the consequences of obedience and disobedience. His role underscores human free will, responsibility for one\u2019s actions, and the ongoing struggle against evil. The narrative frames him as the foundational figure tasked with assuming authority on Earth, learning to confront temptation, and adhering to divine guidance through repentance and accountability.",

Ibn Kathir explains that this tree was a test for Adam, and its prohibition was a means of distinguishing between obedience and disobedience. By disobeying Allah's command, Adam and his wife fell into sin, and were subsequently expelled from Paradise (2:36-37). The story serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the importance of obeying Allah's commands.",
                "generated_answer": "\n<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the significance of the forbidden tree in the story of Adam. The context provided is from the Quranic commentary, specifically Surah Al-Baqarah. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what the text says. The passage mentions that Adam and his spouse were allowed to eat from all the trees in Paradise except one. The forbidden tree is a test. The text says that this test was part of Adam's training for his role as vicegerent on Earth. The key points here are free will, the ability to choose, and the necessity of facing temptation.\n\nThe context explains that the forbidden tree symbolizes the things forbidden by God, which are necessary for humans to have free will. Without such prohibitions, humans would just follow instincts like animals. The test awakens Adam's inner powers and his ability to face temptation, making him responsible for his actions. It also introduces the concept of repentance since Adam repents after eating from the tree, showing that even after mistakes, return to God is possible.\n\nSo the significance includes: testing willpower, enabling free will, preparing Adam for his role on Earth, teaching responsibility, introducing the idea of repentance, and distinguishing humans from animals by their moral choices. The answer should tie these points together based on the provided context without adding external knowledge.\n</think>\n\nThe forbidden tree symbolizes the prohibitions set by God to test humanity's free will and moral agency. Its significance lies in several key aspects:  \n1. **Free Will and Moral Choice**: The prohibition of the tree allows humans to exercise their will, distinguishing them from animals by requiring conscious decision-making.  \n2. **Preparation for Earthly Life**: The test in Paradise was part of Adam\u2019s training for his role as God\u2019s vicegerent on Earth, awakening his inner strength and accountability for actions.  \n3. **Awareness of Consequences**: The ordeal taught Adam the consequences of disregarding divine guidance and the necessity of repentance, as demonstrated by his subsequent plea for forgiveness.  \n4. **Foundation of the Covenant**: It underscores the conditions of the covenant between God and humanity\u2014obedience leads to prosperity, while disobedience invites ruin.  \n\nIn essence, the tree represents the moral framework necessary for humanity\u2019s purpose on Earth, enabling the struggle against evil and the choice between guidance and transgression.",

                "ground_truth": "According to Surah Al-Baqarah (2:109), the Jews of Madinah opposed Islam because they were envious of the Muslims and resented the fact that the revelation was sent to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and not to one of their own. Ibn Kathir explains that they were jealous of the Prophet's prophethood and the fact that the Quran was revealed to him, which led them to reject the truth and oppose the Muslims.",
                "generated_answer": "\n<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure this out based on the provided context. The question is asking why the Jews of Madinah opposed Islam. I need to look through the given text to find the reasons mentioned there.\n\nFirst, the context says that the Jews were the stiffest opposition to the Islamic message when it arrived. They started a campaign against Islam because they realized it was there to stay and take control. The main reasons mentioned are that they felt Islam would deprive them of their moral and economic hegemony. That makes sense because if Islam took over, their previous control in those areas would be threatened.\n\nThen it says Islam began to heal the rifts between the Aws and Khazraj tribes. The Jews had previously exploited the disputes between these tribes, so if the tribes became united, the Jews would lose that advantage. So their opposition was also to prevent losing the power they had by playing the tribes against each other.\n\nAnother point is that the Jews had the option to embrace Islam and assimilate into the Muslim community, but they didn't want to lose their identity and separate existence. The text mentions they didn't want to be marginalized or isolated, so they opposed to maintain their distinct position.\n\nThe Qur'an also criticizes the Jews for being selective in their belief\u2014believing some parts of the Scriptures and denying others. Their violation of their covenant with God is highlighted, like when they fought against each other despite their religious teachings. The verses quoted in the text reproach them for this inconsistency.\n\nAdditionally, the Jews were used to a position of respect due to their religious heritage, and the pagan Arabs looked up to them for religious wisdom. With Islam rising, their esteemed position might be undermined, leading to opposition.\n\nPutting this together, the main reasons are the threat to their power and control, fear of losing their identity, and their historical resistance to new prophets (as implied by their ancestors' behavior). The answer should list these points from the text without adding outside info.\n</think>\n\nThe Jews of Madinah opposed Islam primarily because they feared losing their moral and economic hegemony, which they had long held over the city. Islam threatened to unite the previously rival Arab tribes (Aws and Khazraj), ending the Jews' ability to exploit their disputes. Additionally, they resisted assimilation into the Muslim community, as this would have dissolved their distinct identity and societal influence. The Qur\u2019 an also criticizes their selective adherence to their own scriptures, highlighting their hypocrisy in violating covenants (e.g., engaging in tribal conflicts despite religious teachings), and their historical pattern of opposing prophets. Their opposition persisted due to the perceived threat to their privileged position and their reluctance to accept the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s message.",

They launched a \nrelentless campaign of overt and covert resistance as soon as they realized that it had \ncome to stay and to take control of the city and its population.

Indeed, Muslim communities have no history of \nreligious or racial intolerance, discrimination or persecution. They are known to welcome \npeaceful outsiders who have no intention to undermine Islam or harm its people. It was \nthought that the Jews of Madinah would be the first to welcome Islam and embrace the \nnew religion and its advocate, the Prophet Mu hammad.

The alternative would be to embrace the new faith \nand become assimilated into the Muslim community, losing their identity and separate \nexistence for ever. Their options were thus severely restricted. These factors expl ain the \nstance taken by the Jews towards Islam; a stance which has been extensively explored on \nseveral occasions in the Qur\u2019 an. In this s urah, we find the Qur\u2019 an appealing to the \nIsraelites, reminding them of the attitudes and conduct of their ancestors t owards earlier \nProphets, and recalling their stubbornness and intransigence, and their betrayal of God\u2019s \ntrust and covenant. The images and examples cited from the chequered and turbulent \nJewish past were familiar in Mu hammad\u2019s time, and reflected the true nature of the Jewish \npsyche and attitude.

Verse 13 has their response when told to believe like others: \"Are we to believe as the fools believe?\" and the Qur'an counters that they are the fools.\n\nThe context also mentions their arrogance, contempt for others, and pretending to be something they're not.

                "question": "What lessons does the story of Adam (AS) teach about free will and repentance?",
                "ground_truth": "The story of Adam (AS) in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:35-37) teaches valuable lessons about free will and repentance. According to Ibn Kathir's tafsir, when Allah commanded Adam and his wife to avoid the forbidden tree, He gave them the freedom to choose between obedience and disobedience (2:35). This demonstrates that humans have been endowed with free will, allowing them to make decisions that can lead to either righteousness or sin.\n\nHowever, when Adam and his wife disobeyed Allah's command, they immediately felt remorse and turned to Allah in repentance (2:37). This episode illustrates the importance of seeking forgiveness and repentance when one has erred. Allah's acceptance of their repentance (2:37) shows that He is Merciful and Forgiving, always willing to pardon those who turn to Him with a sincere heart.\n\nIn essence, the story of Adam (AS) in Surah Al-Baqarah emphasizes that humans have the capacity for free will, but also the opportunity to repent and seek forgiveness when they make mistakes. This narrative serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle between good and evil, and the need for constant vigilance and humility in the face of temptation.",
                "generated_answer": "\n<think>\nOkay, I need to answer the question about the lessons from Adam's story regarding free will and repentance based solely on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.\n\nThe context mentions that the test was necessary to awaken Adam's inner powers and ability to face temptation. It emphasizes that Adam had to take responsibility for his actions and bear the consequences. The story shows that he had a choice\u2014either stay true to his covenant with God or yield to temptation. That's about free will because he made a choice.\n\nThen, after Adam sinned, he repented, and God accepted his repentance. The text says Adam took full responsibility for his own sin and after repenting, was absolved. The context also contrasts this with Christian beliefs like original sin and atonement through Jesus, stating that in Islam, sins are personal, and repentance is straightforward without needing someone else's sacrifice.\n\nSo the key points are: \n1. Free will is important because Adam chose to disobey. The test was to let him face temptation and make choices, which is part of his preparation for life on earth. \n2. Repentance is personal and effective. God forgives when one repents sincerely. The story shows that even after sinning, through repentance, Adam was forgiven, highlighting that individuals are responsible for their own actions and can seek forgiveness directly.\n\nI need to make sure not to include anything outside the context. The answer should mention the necessity of the test to develop his ability to handle temptation (free will), taking responsibility, and the process of repentance leading to forgiveness. Also, note that it's a personal responsibility, no atonement through others. The example of Adam's repentance being accepted shows the pathway for humans. The cyclical nature of temptation and repentance is part of human experience, preparing Adam for earth's challenges. \n\nI should structure the answer around these points, using the exact terms from the text like \"free will,\" \"repentance,\" \"personal responsibility,\" and reference the rejection of original sin and the Christian doctrine mentioned. Make sure to tie each lesson back to the context provided.\n</think>\n\nThe story of Adam (AS) teaches that free will is fundamental to human experience, as Adam was tested to awaken his inner strength and ability to face temptation. This test allowed him to choose between obeying God or yielding to Satan\u2019s deception, emphasizing that humans have the autonomy to make moral decisions. Repentance is portrayed as a personal and accessible path to forgiveness: after Adam\u2019s mistake, he repented sincerely, and God accepted his repentance, illustrating that accountability for sin lies solely with the individual. The narrative rejects concepts like \"original sin\" or divine atonement through others (e.g., Jesus\u2019 crucifixion), affirming that forgiveness is direct and unconditional for those who seek it. It underscores that sin and repentance are personal journeys, with God\u2019s mercy ever-available, and that facing temptation is part of preparing humans to resist evil and take responsibility for their actions on Earth.",

However, the tone this time is rather general, presenting pri nciples that apply to \nthe Jews of Madinah as well as other opponents of the new faith. It also identifies a number \nof pitfalls that the Muslims would do well to avoid. To begin with, we have a reference to the \npilgrimage ritual of walking between the two h ills of \u015eaf a and Marwah, near the Ka`bah, \nclarifying the confusion surrounding them as a result of pre -Islamic pagan traditions. To \nsome extent, this is related to the institution of the Ka`bah as the universal direction of \nprayer for Muslims as well as to pilgrimage rituals. This is followed by a fierce \ncondemnation of Jews and Christians who conceal parts of their Scriptures, while making it \nclear that repentance and forgiveness remain open to those of them who wish to refrain \nfrom such practices. Those w ho persist will meet with harsh punishment. Then comes a \nreaffirmation of the concept of God\u2019s oneness, and a reference to the marvels of the \nnatural world that attest to it.

They launched a \nrelentless campaign of overt and covert resistance as soon as they realized that it had \ncome to stay and to take control of the city and its population. They felt that Islam was \nbound to deprive them of the moral and economic hegemony they had so far enjoyed. \nSlowly, Islam began to heal the rifts that had existed between Madinah\u2019s two main rival \nArab tribes, the Aws and the Khazraj, thus ending the disputes that the Jews had been able \nto exploit. At the same time it provided Madinah with an independent code of conduct, \nbased on the Qur\u2019 an. The war the Jews began to wage against Islam and Muslims in those \nearly days has raged on to the present day. The form and appearance may have changed, \nbut the nature and means remain the same. This is in spite of the fact that the Jews, who \nhave been widely persecuted throughout their history, have always been welcomed and \naccommodated by Muslim communities. Indeed, Muslim communities have no history of \nreligious or racial intolerance, discrimination or persecution. They are known to welcome \npeaceful outsiders who have no intention to undermine Islam or harm its people. It was \nthought that the Jews of Madinah would be the first to welcome Islam and embrace the \nnew religion and its advocate, the Prophet Mu hammad.

In fulfilment of \nprophecies found in their own Scriptures and by virtue of the fact that they had been \nawaiting the coming of a prophet to lead them to salva tion, some Jews would tell the \nMuslims at times that they too believed in Mu hammad (peace be upon him). Privately, to \navoid giving the Muslims any evidence they could use to indict them before God, they \nwould strongly reproach one another for overdoing their pretence of belief. Ludicrous as it \nmay appear, they seemed to believe that as long as they did not divulge their true \nconvictions to the Muslims publicly, they would succeed in concealing them from God and \nHe would thereby not hold it against them.

The alternative would be to embrace the new faith \nand become assimilated into the Muslim community, losing their identity and separate \nexistence for ever.

These factors expl ain the \nstance taken by the Jews towards Islam; a stance which has been extensively explored on \nseveral occasions in the Qur\u2019 an.

According to Ibn Kathir's tafsir, when Allah commanded Adam and his wife to avoid the forbidden tree, He gave them the freedom to choose between obedience and disobedience (2:35). This demonstrates that humans have been endowed with free will, allowing them to make decisions that can lead to either righteousness or sin.\n\nHowever, when Adam and his wife disobeyed Allah's command, they immediately felt remorse and turned to Allah in repentance (2:37). This episode illustrates the importance of seeking forgiveness and repentance when one has erred. Allah's acceptance of their repentance (2:37) shows that He is Merciful and Forgiving, always willing to pardon those who turn to Him with a sincere heart.\n\nIn essence, the story of Adam (AS) in Surah Al-Baqarah emphasizes that humans have the capacity for free will, but also the opportunity to repent and seek forgiveness when they make mistakes. This narrative serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle between good and evil, and the need for constant vigilance and humility in the face of temptation.",
                "generated_answer": "The story of Adam (AS) teaches that humans have free will, as evident from Adam's ability to choose between obeying or disobeying God's command. Adam's disobedience and subsequent repentance demonstrate that humans can make mistakes, but they can also seek forgiveness and repent. The story highlights the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions, as Adam took full responsibility for his sin. The narrative also shows that God accepts repentance and forgives those who sincerely seek forgiveness, as seen in the case of Adam. This teaches that repentance is a personal and straightforward process, and that individuals are not burdened with the sins of others, but are instead accountable for their own actions.",

However, the tone this time is rather general, presenting pri nciples that apply to \nthe Jews of Madinah as well as other opponents of the new faith. It also identifies a number \nof pitfalls that the Muslims would do well to avoid. To begin with, we have a reference to the \npilgrimage ritual of walking between the two h ills of \u015eaf a and Marwah, near the Ka`bah, \nclarifying the confusion surrounding them as a result of pre -Islamic pagan traditions. To \nsome extent, this is related to the institution of the Ka`bah as the universal direction of \nprayer for Muslims as well as to pilgrimage rituals. This is followed by a fierce \ncondemnation of Jews and Christians who conceal parts of their Scriptures, while making it \nclear that repentance and forgiveness remain open to those of them who wish to refrain \nfrom such practices. Those w ho persist will meet with harsh punishment. Then comes a \nreaffirmation of the concept of God\u2019s oneness, and a reference to the marvels of the \nnatural world that attest to it.

At a place called `Aqabah near \nMakkah, the Prophet had two crucial historic meetings in 621 and 622 CE with a group of \nArabs from Madinah , during which they pledged their allegiance and support. This was to \nhave a profound and far -reaching effect on the whole future of Islam and the Muslim \ncommunity. Towards the end of the Makkan period, the Prophet Mu hammad embarked on \na concerted effort o f making contact with various influential Arab communities and tribes \nto introduce Islam to them and seek their following and support.

A group of the Khazraj pilgrims met the \nProphet who explained to them his message. They immediately realized that he was the \nvery Prop het the Jews were talking about. They were determined to get to him before the \nJews did. Having met him and listened to what he had to say, they accepted him and \nbecame Muslims. They said to him: \u201cWe have left our people in an unprecedented state of \nmutual hostility.

According to Ibn Kathir's tafsir, when Allah commanded Adam and his wife to avoid the forbidden tree, He gave them the freedom to choose between obedience and disobedience (2:35). This demonstrates that humans have been endowed with free will, allowing them to make decisions that can lead to either righteousness or sin.\n\nHowever, when Adam and his wife disobeyed Allah's command, they immediately felt remorse and turned to Allah in repentance (2:37). This episode illustrates the importance of seeking forgiveness and repentance when one has erred. Allah's acceptance of their repentance (2:37) shows that He is Merciful and Forgiving, always willing to pardon those who turn to Him with a sincere heart.\n\nIn essence, the story of Adam (AS) in Surah Al-Baqarah emphasizes that humans have the capacity for free will, but also the opportunity to repent and seek forgiveness when they make mistakes.

The Quran reminds Muslims of the favors Allah bestowed upon the Israelites, such as liberating them from Pharaoh's tyranny (2:49-50) and providing them with the Torah (2:53). However, the Israelites repeatedly disobeyed Allah, broke their covenants, and rejected their prophets (2:55-59).\n\nThe Quran warns Muslims not to follow in the footsteps of the Israelites, lest they suffer a similar fate (2:61). It emphasizes the importance of obeying Allah's commands, being grateful for His blessings, and heeding the lessons of history. By recalling the Israelites' mistakes, the Quran cautions Muslims against pride, arrogance, and complacency, encouraging them to remain humble and faithful to their covenant with Allah (2:63-64).",

Overall, people look the same and \npossess the same limbs and organs, wi th essentially the same physical, biological and \nchemical constitution. But how far does this similarity go? How different can people be in \ntheir habits and aptitudes? For, despite the striking physical similarity, such differences \ncan be vast indeed. Vari ety and diversity in God\u2019s creation can be great indeed. There is \nvariety in living species and in human races; there is diversity in shapes and features, as \nwell as qualities and characteristics.

They thus hoped to undermine the authority and authenticity of the \nQur\u2019an. These verses serve to refute that argument and explain the wisdom underlying the \nuse of such parables, while warning unbelievers against taking up such a line of argument \nand reassuring believers that they will strengthen their faith. \u201cGod does not disd ain to give a \nparable of a gnat, or a higher creature.\u201d (Verse 26) God is the Lord of all creatures, big and \nsmall.

                "ground_truth": "According to Surah Al-Baqarah (2:34), Adam (A.S) is the first human being created by Allah, and the first to be addressed by Allah with a command, when Allah commanded him to dwell in Paradise with his wife, Hawwa' (Eve). Ibn Kathir explains that Adam was created from clay and was given the gift of knowledge, and Allah taught him the names of all things.",
                "generated_answer": "\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out who Adam (A.S) is based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context again to make sure I understand the details.\n\nThe context is from the Quran, specifically Surah Al-Baqarah (The Cow). The verses mentioned are 31-36 and some following discussion. The story here is about Adam and the angels. The angels are told to prostrate before Adam, except Iblis who refuses. Then there's the part where Adam is tested in Paradise, told not to eat from a tree, but Satan tempts them, leading to their expulsion. The text also mentions Adam's repentance and God's forgiveness.\n\nThe question is asking \"Who is Adam (A.S)?\" The answer should be based solely on the given context. Let me note the key points about Adam from the text:\n\n1. Adam is the one to whom God taught the names (as in verse 33 where he tells the angels their names). This shows Adam's knowledge and perhaps his role as a representative of God's wisdom.\n2. He was commanded by God to dwell in Paradise and eat from the trees except one. He and his spouse were tempted by Satan and ate from the forbidden tree, leading to their expulsion. This test was part of their preparation for life on Earth.\n3. After their mistake, Adam repented, and God accepted his repentance. This shows Adam's accountability and the possibility of forgiveness.\n4. The story emphasizes that Adam's sin was his own responsibility, and he bore the consequences, which is a lesson that each person is responsible for their own actions.\n5. The context mentions that Adam was elevated above the angels because of his knowledge and free will. The angels prostrated to him except Iblis, showing Adam's special status.\n6. The narrative also contrasts Adam's obedience (after repentance) with Iblis/Satan's disobedience. Adam's role is central in the story of humanity's creation and testing.\n\nThe question is asking for who Adam (A.S) is. The (A.S) is likely an honorific, like \"Alayhi Assalam\" (peace be upon him), so the answer should reflect his significance in Islam as per the context.\n\nPutting it together, the answer should mention Adam as the first human, chosen by God, given knowledge (names), tested in Paradise, sinned but repented and was forgiven. Highlight his role as the one given authority on Earth, the test being part of his preparation, and the lessons from his story about accountability and repentance. Also, note his elevation over the angels due to his knowledge and free will. Need to avoid any external knowledge, like Biblical details not in the context. The context doesn't mention his relation to Jesus or atonement, so stick to what's here. The answer should be concise but cover these points from the given text.\n</think>\n\nAdam (A.S) is portrayed in the Quranic context as the first human elevated by God with the ability to assign names and recognize the \"secrets of what is in the heavens and the earth\" (Verse 33). This knowledge signifies his unique wisdom and authority. He was tested in Paradise, instructed to avoid a specific tree, but succumbed to Satan\u2019s deception, leading to his expulsion. However, he repented, and God accepted his repentance, emphasizing accountability for one\u2019s actions and the availability of forgiveness. Adam\u2019s prostration by the angels (except Ibl\u012bs) highlights his elevated spiritual status due to his endowed free will and intellectual capacity. His story underscores human responsibility, the consequences of disobedience, and the path to redemption. He is central to the narrative of humanity\u2019s creation, preparation for life on Earth, and the ongoing struggle against evil, serving as a model for bearing personal sin and seeking divine mercy.",

The context explains that the forbidden tree symbolizes the things forbidden to man on earth.

The context also mentions their envy that God chose Muhammad, not them, as the recipients of the new message. \n\nSo putting it all together, the main reasons are envy of Muhammad's prophethood, their arrogance, refusal to accept the new revelations despite their scriptures foretelling a messenger, and their tendency to conspire against Muslims to maintain their own power and interests.\n</think>\n\nThe Jews of Madinah opposed Islam primarily due to their envy of Muhammad\u2019s prophethood, as he was the Messenger they had been foretold to await.

They also sought to protect their own interests by conspiring against Muslims, undermining the Prophet, and aligning with his enemies. Additionally, their ingrained tendency to reject blessings for others, coupled with a desire to maintain their perceived superiority, led them to violate their covenants and spread discord.

The user is asking what the Quran says about the hypocrites (Munafiqun). \n\nFirst, I need to recall the context given. The text talks about hypocrites in Madinah, called al-Munafiqun. They are described as people who didn't have sincere faith. The key points mentioned are:\n\n1. Their criteria for good/evil and right/wrong are based on personal desires, not God's standards. They are reprimanded for spreading corruption without realizing it (Verse 12 mentioned twice).\n\n2. They are arrogant, look down on others, and pretend to be something they're not. When told to believe as others, they mock the idea, calling others \"fools\" but are actually the fools themselves (Verse 13).\n\n3. They claim to do good but actually spread corruption. They don't see their own corruption (Verse 11-12 again).\n\n4. They are obstinate, justify their actions, and think they'll escape punishment. They tell lies and deceive, making false claims.\n\n5. The Quran uses a metaphor of someone whose light is taken away, leaving them in darkness (Verses 6-7). The example given is Abdallah ibn Ubayy, who pretended to be a Muslim to maintain status but was actually a hypocrite.\n\n6. The Quran warns them of punishment for their lies and hypocrisy. The surah (Al-Baqarah) details their traits to expose their harmful role in the community.\n\nSo putting this together, the answer should list these points, citing the relevant verses and the characteristics like their arrogance, deceit, false claims of goodness, spreading corruption, and the consequences mentioned. Also, mention the metaphor of light and darkness, and the example of Ibn Ubayy.

Their key traits include:  \n\n1. **Corruption and Deception**: They are \"the ones who do spread corruption\" (Verse 12) while falsely claiming to do good. Their actions undermine society, yet they remain unaware of their true status.  \n\n2. **Arrogance and Mockery**: They mock genuine believers, dismissing faith as fit only for \"fools\" (Verse 13). The Qur'an rebukes them, stating *they* are the true fools.  \n\n3. **Rejection of Sincere Faith**: They refuse to join those who embrace Islam wholly, prioritizing pride over submission to God.  \n\n4. **False Pretenses**: They justify their corruption, believing they will evade accountability. Their lies and deceit lead to \"painful suffering\" for their falsehoods (Verse 10).  \n\n5. **Metaphor of Light and Darkness**: They are likened to someone whose light is taken away, leaving them in darkness (Verses 6\u20137), symbolizing their spiritual blindness.  \n\n6. **Consequences**: The Qur'an warns of their eventual punishment and describes their state as \"miserable and totally lost\" due to their hypocrisy.  \n\nThe text emphasizes their harmful role in destabilizing the Muslim community, using examples like Abdallah ibn Ubayy, who feigned faith to preserve his status.

                    "them.\u201d (Verses 6 -7) In Madinah, a third group emerged, the hypocrites, or al -Munafiqun. \nThis faction had not been noticeable in Makkah; its rise was prompted by the Prophet\u2019s \narrival and settlement in Madinah, as outlined earlier. That was because in Makkah, Islam \nhad no sovereign political entity or force, and the Muslims remained soft ta rgets for \npersecution and repression by the rest of the Arabs. Those who accepted Islam had to be \nbrave and sincere, prepared to endure all kinds of hardship and terror. In Madinah, hitherto \nknown as Yathrib, the picture was very different.

                "ground_truth": "The story of Adam (AS) in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:35-37) teaches valuable lessons about free will and repentance. According to Ibn Kathir's tafsir, when Allah commanded Adam and his wife to avoid the forbidden tree, He gave them the freedom to choose between obedience and disobedience (2:35). This demonstrates that humans have been endowed with free will, allowing them to make decisions that can lead to either righteousness or sin.\n\nHowever, when Adam and his wife disobeyed Allah's command, they immediately felt remorse and turned to Allah in repentance (2:37). This episode illustrates the importance of seeking forgiveness and repentance when one has erred. Allah's acceptance of their repentance (2:37) shows that He is Merciful and Forgiving, always willing to pardon those who turn to Him with a sincere heart.\n\nIn essence, the story of Adam (AS) in Surah Al-Baqarah emphasizes that humans have the capacity for free will, but also the opportunity to repent and seek forgiveness when they make mistakes. This narrative serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle between good and evil, and the need for constant vigilance and humility in the face of temptation.",
                "generated_answer": "\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to answer the question about what lessons the story of Adam (AS) teaches regarding free will and repentance, based only on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully to make sure I don't miss any key points.\n\nFirst, the text mentions that Adam was tested in Paradise. The test involved the forbidden tree. The story says that Adam disregarded his covenant with God and was tempted by Satan. This shows that Adam had free will because he chose to disobey. The context emphasizes that Adam's sin was his own choice, not something he was born with, which contrasts with the Christian idea of original sin. \n\nThen, after Adam repents, God accepts his repentance. The text says, \"Adam took full responsibility for his sin, which he personally committed. Having repented, he was simply and easily absolved of it.\" That's a direct point about repentance being effective and personal. The context also states that \"any sins committed by Adam\u2019s offspring would likewise be totally personal,\" meaning each person is responsible for their own actions. \n\nThe part about free will is reinforced by the idea that humans can choose to follow God's commands or yield to desires. The story highlights that humans have the ability to make choices, like when Adam chose to eat from the tree. The mention of Iblis refusing to prostrate to Adam also shows free will since Iblis made a conscious choice to disobey God's command, leading to his rejection.\n\nThe text also says that the test was to awaken Adam's inner powers and face temptation, showing that free will is part of human testing. The lesson here is that through free will, humans can either adhere to their covenant with God or give in to temptation. \n\nRegarding repentance, the context emphasizes that the gateway to repentance is open to all without restriction. It's a personal act, and forgiveness is possible when one repents sincerely. The story of Adam's repentance being accepted underscores that individuals must take responsibility for their sins and seek forgiveness directly, without needing an intermediary like the Christian doctrine of atonement through Jesus.\n\nSo putting this together, the key lessons are: \n1. Humans have free will to choose right or wrong. \n2. Each person is responsible for their own sins. \n3. Repentance is available to all, and sincere repentance leads to forgiveness. \n4. The story contrasts with other beliefs (like original sin) to stress personal accountability.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include anything outside the given context. The answer should reference the points about personal responsibility, the availability of repentance, and the role of free will in making choices. Also, the test in Paradise was to prepare Adam for life on Earth, showing that free will is essential for growth and moral responsibility.\n</think>\n\nThe story of Adam (AS) teaches that humans possess **free will** to choose between obeying God or yielding to temptation. Adam\u2019s decision to disregard his covenant with God and heed Satan\u2019s deception demonstrates this free will, as he acted of his own volition. Conversely, his subsequent **repentance** and God\u2019s acceptance of it illustrate that forgiveness is attainable through sincere remorse. The narrative emphasizes **personal responsibility**: sins are entirely the individual\u2019s burden, as no one is born bearing another\u2019s sin (contrary to the Christian concept of \"original sin\"). Repentance is portrayed as a direct, accessible path to absolution for anyone, without restriction. Additionally, the trial in Paradise underscores that free will is essential for moral growth, as humans must confront temptation to develop accountability. The story thus highlights that humans are judged by their choices and can always return to God through repentance.",

                "ground_truth": "Surah Al-Baqarah (2:47-61) uses the Israelites' history as a warning for Muslims by highlighting their disobedience, ingratitude, and rebellion against Allah's commands. The Quran reminds Muslims of the favors Allah bestowed upon the Israelites, such as liberating them from Pharaoh's tyranny (2:49-50) and providing them with the Torah (2:53). However, the Israelites repeatedly disobeyed Allah, broke their covenants, and rejected their prophets (2:55-59).\n\nThe Quran warns Muslims not to follow in the footsteps of the Israelites, lest they suffer a similar fate (2:61). It emphasizes the importance of obeying Allah's commands, being grateful for His blessings, and heeding the lessons of history. By recalling the Israelites' mistakes, the Quran cautions Muslims against pride, arrogance, and complacency, encouraging them to remain humble and faithful to their covenant with Allah (2:63-64).",
                "generated_answer": "\n<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how the Qur'an uses the history of the Israelites as a warning for Muslims based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context again carefully.\n\nThe context mentions that the Qur'an recounts the history of the Israelites, their covenant with God, how they violated it, and their ingratitude despite God's favors. It says this account is a warning to Muslims against following the Israelites' example. The key points here are the Israelites' breaches of their covenant, their ingratitude, and their subsequent humiliation. \n\nThe text also states that when Muslims deviate from Islam, they face similar consequences like weakness and humiliation. The Israelites' history is used to caution Muslims against repeating those mistakes. Additionally, the Israelites opposed their prophets and conspired against Muslims, leading the Qur'an to attack their claims and position Muslims as the true heirs of Abraham's covenant instead. \n\nThe answer should highlight that the Qur'an warns Muslims by showing the Israelites' failures\u2014breaking covenants, ingratitude, alliances with Islam's enemies\u2014and the resulting punishments. It emphasizes learning from these to avoid the same fate. I need to make sure I only use the given context and not external knowledge. \n\nWait, the context also mentions that the Qur'an's account isn't chronological but selects events to serve as warnings. It's about avoiding the Israelites' pitfalls like disbelief, rejecting God's messages, and their ingratitude. The answer should tie these elements together, showing how the Qur'an uses these historical examples to admonish Muslims to stay faithful to their covenant and avoid the Israelites' mistakes.\n</think>\n\nThe Qur'an uses the history of the Israelites as a warning to Muslims by highlighting their breaches of their covenant with God, their ingratitude despite divine favors, and their eventual humiliation due to their disobedience. It emphasizes that when Muslims deviate from Islam\u2014such as persecuting believers, rejecting divine guidance, or allying with Islam's enemies\u2014they risk facing similar consequences: weakness, division, and humiliation. The account also serves to caution Muslims against repeating the Israelites' pitfalls, such as disbelief, rejecting God's revelations, and conspiring against faithful communities. By contrasting the Israelites' fate with the responsibilities of Muslims as God's new vicegerents and custodians of His message, the Qur'an underscores the need for Muslims to remain faithful to their covenant with God, learn from these historical examples, and avoid the arrogance and stubbornness that led to the Israelites' downfall.",

All generations of the Jewish \nnation are addressed as one group. The attack ends with an admonition to the Musli ms \nnever to hold any hope that the Jews will ever reconcile themselves to accepting or \nacknowledging Islam. It goes on to lambast the Jewish claim to the monotheistic legacy of \nAbraham, and to establish Mu hammad and his followers as the true heirs of Abrah am\u2019s \nfaith who are entitled to inherit his covenant with God.

The Jews had settled in three well -defined areas of \nMadinah and made various agreements with their Arab neighbours from both tribes. The \nJewish tribes of Qaynuq a` and al-Nad\u012br allied themselves with the Khazraj tribe, while the \nQuray\u017cah allied itself with the Aws. Whenever war broke out between the two major Arab \ntribes, the Jewish inhabitants would side with their respective allies, so that Jew killed Jew, \nin complete violation of their covenant wit h God.

As soon as hostilities ceased, Jews \non both sides would hurry to exchange Jewish captives or buy their freedom, in fulfilment of \nthe Torah teachings. The co ntradiction underlying this behaviour is exposed and the Jews \nare strongly reproached: \u201cDo you, then, believe in some parts of the Scriptures and deny \nothers?\u201d (Verse 85) This is the very violation of their covenant for which they are given a very \nstern warning: \u201cThose of you who do this will have nothing for their r eward other than \nignominy in this life and, on the Day of Resurrection, they shall be committed to a most \ngrievous suffering.

According to Ibn Kathir's tafsir, when Allah commanded Adam and his wife to avoid the forbidden tree, He gave them the freedom to choose between obedience and disobedience (2:35). This demonstrates that humans have been endowed with free will, allowing them to make decisions that can lead to either righteousness or sin.\n\nHowever, when Adam and his wife disobeyed Allah's command, they immediately felt remorse and turned to Allah in repentance (2:37). This episode illustrates the importance of seeking forgiveness and repentance when one has erred. Allah's acceptance of their repentance (2:37) shows that He is Merciful and Forgiving, always willing to pardon those who turn to Him with a sincere heart.\n\nIn essence, the story of Adam (AS) in Surah Al-Baqarah emphasizes that humans have the capacity for free will, but also the opportunity to repent and seek forgiveness when they make mistakes. This narrative serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle between good and evil, and the need for constant vigilance and humility in the face of temptation.",

Adam took full responsibility for his sin, repented, and was subsequently forgiven by God.

                "ground_truth": "The story of Adam (AS) in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:35-37) teaches valuable lessons about free will and repentance. According to Ibn Kathir's tafsir, when Allah commanded Adam and his wife to avoid the forbidden tree, He gave them the freedom to choose between obedience and disobedience (2:35). This demonstrates that humans have been endowed with free will, allowing them to make decisions that can lead to either righteousness or sin.\n\nHowever, when Adam and his wife disobeyed Allah's command, they immediately felt remorse and turned to Allah in repentance (2:37). This episode illustrates the importance of seeking forgiveness and repentance when one has erred. Allah's acceptance of their repentance (2:37) shows that He is Merciful and Forgiving, always willing to pardon those who turn to Him with a sincere heart.\n\nIn essence, the story of Adam (AS) in Surah Al-Baqarah emphasizes that humans have the capacity for free will, but also the opportunity to repent and seek forgiveness when they make mistakes. This narrative serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle between good and evil, and the need for constant vigilance and humility in the face of temptation.",

Ibn Kathir explains that Adam was created from clay and was given the gift of knowledge, and Allah taught him the names of all things.",
                "generated_answer": "\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out who Adam (A.S) is based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context again to make sure I understand the references to Adam.\n\nThe context is from the Quran, specifically Surah Al-Baqarah (The Cow). The verses mentioned are 30-34 and some others. The story here is about God teaching Adam the names of all things and then testing the angels by asking them to name these things. The angels admit they don't know, but Adam can, which shows God's knowledge. Then God commands the angels to prostrate to Adam, and all do except Iblis (Satan), who refuses. Later, Adam and Eve are told to dwell in Paradise but are tempted by Satan and end up being sent down to Earth.\n\nThe question is asking who Adam (A.S) is according to this context. The answer should be based solely on the given text. The user mentioned \"A.S\" which is an abbreviation for \"Alayhi Salatu wa Sallam\" (May peace and blessings be upon him), a common Islamic honorific for prophets.\n\nLooking at the context, Adam is presented as the one to whom God taught the names of all things. When God tests the angels by asking them to name these things, they can't, but Adam can. This shows Adam's knowledge and his special status. Then, God commands the angels to prostrate to Adam, which they do except Iblis. This indicates that Adam is honored by God, made a vicegerent (khalifah) on Earth, as mentioned in verse 30 where God says He is appointing a vicegerent on Earth, and the angels question this, but God affirms His knowledge.\n\nSo, the key points from the text about Adam are that he was taught by God the names of all things, demonstrated this knowledge in front of the angels, was the one the angels were commanded to prostrate to (except Iblis), and was appointed as a vicegerent on Earth. Additionally, after being tested in Paradise (not detailed here but referenced in verse 35-36 where they are told to dwell in Paradise but are tempted and exiled), he repents and is accepted by God.\n\nThe answer should compile these elements: Adam is the first human, chosen by God to be vicegerent on Earth, given knowledge of the names (which signifies wisdom and understanding), proven his worth over the angels in this test, and despite the fall from Paradise, he remains a prophet and righteous servant of God. The context doesn't mention his status as a prophet explicitly, but in Islamic tradition, he's considered the first prophet. However, the given text might not use the term \"prophet\" but shows his elevated status through the test and God's favor.\n\nWait, the context does mention that after being sent down to Earth, Adam received \"certain words\" from his Lord, and God accepted his repentance. So Adam is portrayed as someone who repents and is forgiven, showing obedience. The main points from the text are his knowledge of the names, his role as vicegerent, and his test in Paradise leading to exile but eventual forgiveness.\n\nI should make sure not to include any external knowledge beyond the provided text. The answer must be strictly based on the context given. So the answer should list Adam's role as the one taught the names, the one the angels were to prostrate to, the vicegerent appointed by God, and perhaps his testing and repentance. The title (A.S) is an honorific, so in the answer, I can note that the text shows him as a righteous servant favored by God, but since the question is asking \"who is Adam (A.S)\", the answer should focus on the details from the text.\n\nPutting it all together, the answer should state that Adam is the one appointed by God as vicegerent on Earth, given knowledge of the names, demonstrated this to the angels proving his superiority in that aspect, and despite the fall from Paradise, he remained a righteous figure whose repentance was accepted by God. The key elements from the text are his knowledge, his role as vicegerent, the test with the angels, and the prostration command, plus the exile and repentance.\n</think>\n\nAdam (A.S) is depicted in the context as the first human appointed by God as a vicegerent (khalifah) on Earth. God taught him the names of all things, granting him unique knowledge and the ability to assign symbolic names to objects, which the angels could not do. This demonstrated Adam\u2019s superiority in this capacity, leading God to affirm His omniscience and wisdom. The angels, except for Ibl\u012bs, prostrated to Adam as commanded by God, signifying his elevated status. Despite being tempted by Satan and exiled from Paradise for transgressing God\u2019s command, Adam later received divine forgiveness through repentance, showing his obedience and submission. The narrative highlights his role as a trusted servant of God, chosen for his cognitive and moral agency, and affirmed as worthy of the angels\u2019 reverence.",

By disobeying Allah's command, Adam and his wife fell into sin, and were subsequently expelled from Paradise (2:36-37).

Let me read through the context again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe context talks about how Adam was in Paradise and had a test involving a tree he wasn't allowed to approach. The text mentions that the forbidden tree symbolizes the things forbidden to man on earth. It's necessary because without such prohibitions, humans wouldn't have free will; they'd just act on instinct like animals. The test was part of Adam's training to face temptation, learn consequences, and take responsibility. The tree's prohibition allowed Adam to recognize evil (like Iblis), experience repentance, and understand the need to seek God's forgiveness.

The context says it's a symbol of the forbidden things on earth that allow free will. The test with the tree was to awaken Adam's inner powers, let him face temptation, see consequences, take responsibility, identify his enemy (Satan), experience repentance, and understand the need to return to God. The tree's role is crucial because without it, there's no test of willpower, and humans wouldn't be different from animals. So the main points are: symbol of forbidden things, necessity for free will, part of preparation for Earth, teaches facing temptation and consequences, and part of the ongoing struggle against evil.\n</think>\n\nThe forbidden tree symbolizes the prohibitions and trials that test human free will, essential for distinguishing humans from animals. Its significance lies in its role as a necessary test to awaken Adam's inner strength, teach him to confront temptation, understand the consequences of his actions, and develop accountability. It also allowed Adam to recognize evil (embodied by Ibl\u012bs), experience repentance, and seek God's forgiveness, preparing him for life on earth where he must continually resist evil. Without such trials, humans would lack the willpower needed to fulfill their role as God's vicegerents, reduced to instinct-driven creatures. The tree thus represents the foundational struggle between obedience and temptation, crucial for moral growth and spiritual responsibility.",

                "ground_truth": "According to Surah Al-Baqarah, the hypocrites (Munafiqun) are those who claim to be believers but conceal their disbelief (2:8-10). They are described as having a disease in their hearts, which Allah increases for them (2:10). The Quran also warns that the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire (2:114).\n\nIbn Kathir explains that the hypocrites are those who outwardly display Islam but inwardly reject it, and that their condition is worse than that of the open disbelievers (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 2:8-10).\n\nAdditionally, Surah Al-Baqarah (2:14-15) describes the hypocrites as those who try to deceive Allah and the believers, but ultimately deceive only themselves. They are also described as being hesitant and uncertain, neither being with the believers nor with the disbelievers (2:14-15).\n\nIn summary, Surah Al-Baqarah portrays the hypocrites as those who pretend to be believers but are actually disbelievers, and warns of their severe punishment in the Hereafter.",
                "generated_answer": "\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question about what the Qur'an says regarding the hypocrites (Munafiqun) based on the provided context. First, I need to make sure I only use the information given in the text and not rely on any outside knowledge. \n\nThe user provided a lengthy excerpt from the surah Al-Baqarah (The Cow) which discusses hypocrites. The key points mentioned here include their criteria for good and evil being based on personal desires rather than God's standards. The text mentions they are severely reprimanded for spreading corruption without realizing it. \n\nLooking at the verses cited, like Verse 12 and 13, the hypocrites are criticized for their arrogance and contempt towards others. They refuse to believe as others have, calling themselves above the \"fools\" who do believe, but the Qur'an labels them as the real fools. There's also mention of their deceitful behavior, where they claim to do good while actually causing corruption. \n\nAnother point is their lack of sincere faith, leading them to spread lies and instability within the Muslim community. The text also refers to their punishment, like being left in darkness and facing painful suffering for their lies. The discussion emphasizes their hypocrisy by contrasting their false claims of goodness with their actual corrupt actions. \n\nAdditionally, the context explains that the Qur'an details their characteristics because their role in undermining the early Muslim community was significant. They are portrayed as those who don't realize their own foolishness and corruption, and their arrogance makes them reject the true teachings. \n\nI should make sure to include specific verses and the key traits mentioned: their rejection of true faith, their arrogance, spreading corruption, lying, and the consequences they face. Also, note that the Qur'an addresses them as being in darkness and the examples given in the verses like 12, 13, and 16. \n\nWait, the user wants the answer based ONLY on the provided context. Let me check again. The text mentions that their criteria of good/evil aren't from God, they're called corruptors, they mock believers as fools but are the real fools, they claim to do good but actually spread corruption, and they face severe reprimand and punishment. Also, their hypocrisy leads to them being left in darkness and their lies. \n\nSo putting this together, the answer should list these points, referencing the verses as per the context given. Need to ensure not to add anything beyond what's in the provided text.\n</think>\n\nThe Qur'an, in the context provided, describes the hypocrites (Munafiqun) as follows:  \n1. **Corruptors Unaware of Their Wrongdoing**: They are \"the ones who do spread corruption, though they do not realize it\" (Verse 12). Their criteria for good and evil are based on personal desires, not God's standards, leading them to spread corruption while remaining oblivious to their sin.  \n\n2. **Arrogance and Contempt**: They reject sincere faith due to arrogance, mocking believers as \"fools\" when called to join them. The Qur'an rebukes them: \"It is indeed they who are fools, though they do not know it\" (Verse 13).  \n\n3. **Deceptive Claims of Virtue**: They falsely claim to \"do good\" while actively causing corruption, refusing to acknowledge their wrongdoing (Verses 11\u201312).  \n\n4. **Condemnation and Punishment**: They are severely reprimanded and warned of \"painful suffering\" for their lies and deceit (Verse 10). Their fate is described as being left in \"darkness\" after attempting to \"kindle a fire,\" symbolizing their spiritual blindness and failure (Verse 17).  \n\n5. **Role in Undermining the Community**: Their hypocrisy, instability, and scheming against the Muslim community are highlighted as a persistent threat, emphasizing the need to expose their corrupt actions.  \n\nThese traits and consequences are outlined to underscore their moral and spiritual failure, rooted in arrogance and rejection of divine guidance.",

                "question": "What lessons does the story of Adam (AS) teach about free will and repentance?",
                "ground_truth": "The story of Adam (AS) in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:35-37) teaches valuable lessons about free will and repentance. According to Ibn Kathir's tafsir, when Allah commanded Adam and his wife to avoid the forbidden tree, He gave them the freedom to choose between obedience and disobedience (2:35). This demonstrates that humans have been endowed with free will, allowing them to make decisions that can lead to either righteousness or sin.\n\nHowever, when Adam and his wife disobeyed Allah's command, they immediately felt remorse and turned to Allah in repentance (2:37). This episode illustrates the importance of seeking forgiveness and repentance when one has erred. Allah's acceptance of their repentance (2:37) shows that He is Merciful and Forgiving, always willing to pardon those who turn to Him with a sincere heart.\n\nIn essence, the story of Adam (AS) in Surah Al-Baqarah emphasizes that humans have the capacity for free will, but also the opportunity to repent and seek forgiveness when they make mistakes. This narrative serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle between good and evil, and the need for constant vigilance and humility in the face of temptation.",
                "generated_answer": "\n<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the lessons from Adam's story regarding free will and repentance. I need to base my answer strictly on the provided context.\n\nFirst, looking at the context, it mentions that the test was necessary to awaken Adam's inner powers and ability to face temptation. That points to free will because Adam had a choice to obey or not. The text also says he had to bear responsibility for his actions, which is about exercising free will and then dealing with consequences.\n\nThen, the part where Adam disobeys by approaching the forbidden tree. The story talks about him realizing his mistake, feeling sorrow, and seeking forgiveness. The context emphasizes that his repentance was accepted, showing that repentance is possible and effective. \n\nThe answer also needs to mention that each person is responsible for their own sins, no one else bears that burden. The text specifically says \"any sins committed by Adam's offspring would likewise be totally personal\" and \"none shall carry the burden of another.\" So that's a key point about individual responsibility.\n\nAdditionally, the context contrasts this with Christian beliefs about atonement through Jesus, but in Islam, it's about personal repentance. The story teaches that the gateway to repentance is open to all, so it's accessible and necessary for everyone.\n\nPutting this together, the main lessons are: \n1. Free will is essential as Adam had the choice to obey or disobey. \n2. Taking responsibility for one's actions and the consequences. \n3. Repentance is possible and leads to forgiveness. \n4. Each person's sins are their own; they can't transfer blame or need a savior for collective sin. \n\nI need to make sure I don't include anything outside the given text. The answer should reference the test as part of preparation, the necessity of facing temptation, and the acceptance of sincere repentance. Also, the part where Adam's naming the names shows knowledge and covenant with God, but maybe that's more about his role as vicegerent. The key points are free will, responsibility, repentance's effectiveness, and individual accountability.\n</think>\n\nThe story of Adam (AS) teaches that free will is essential for human growth and moral responsibility. Adam\u2019s test in Paradise\u2014choosing whether to obey or disobey\u2014demonstrates that free will allows individuals to confront temptation, recognize consequences, and bear accountability for their actions. His disregard for the covenant with God highlights the necessity of resisting deception and exercising moral agency.  \n\nRegarding repentance, the narrative shows that sincere repentance leads to forgiveness. After Adam and Eve\u2019s mistake, their acknowledgment of error, sorrow, and plea for mercy resulted in divine acceptance. This underscores that repentance is accessible to all, emphasizing personal accountability: sins are entirely individual, and no one bears another\u2019s burden. The story rejects concepts like collective atonement (e.g., through a divine figure\u2019s sacrifice), affirming that repentance is a direct, personal path to forgiveness. Thus, the lessons are: free will enables choice and responsibility, while repentance\u2014when genuine\u2014ensures redemption, with each individual\u2019s actions and accountability central to this process.",

However, the tone this time is rather general, presenting pri nciples that apply to \nthe Jews of Madinah as well as other opponents of the new faith. It also identifies a number \nof pitfalls that the Muslims would do well to avoid. To begin with, we have a reference to the \npilgrimage ritual of walking between the two h ills of \u015eaf a and Marwah, near the Ka`bah, \nclarifying the confusion surrounding them as a result of pre -Islamic pagan traditions.

In fulfilment of \nprophecies found in their own Scriptures and by virtue of the fact that they had been \nawaiting the coming of a prophet to lead them to salva tion, some Jews would tell the \nMuslims at times that they too believed in Mu hammad (peace be upon him). Privately, to \navoid giving the Muslims any evidence they could use to indict them before God, they \nwould strongly reproach one another for overdoing their pretence of belief. Ludicrous as it \nmay appear, they seemed to believe that as long as they did not divulge their true \nconvictions to the Muslims publicly, they would succeed in concealing them from God and \nHe would thereby not hold it against them.

They are also described as being hesitant and uncertain, neither being with the believers nor with the disbelievers (2:14-15).\n\nIn summary, Surah Al-Baqarah portrays the hypocrites as those who pretend to be believers but are actually disbelievers, and warns of their severe punishment in the Hereafter.",

                "ground_truth": "The story of Adam (AS) in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:35-37) teaches valuable lessons about free will and repentance. According to Ibn Kathir's tafsir, when Allah commanded Adam and his wife to avoid the forbidden tree, He gave them the freedom to choose between obedience and disobedience (2:35). This demonstrates that humans have been endowed with free will, allowing them to make decisions that can lead to either righteousness or sin.\n\nHowever, when Adam and his wife disobeyed Allah's command, they immediately felt remorse and turned to Allah in repentance (2:37). This episode illustrates the importance of seeking forgiveness and repentance when one has erred. Allah's acceptance of their repentance (2:37) shows that He is Merciful and Forgiving, always willing to pardon those who turn to Him with a sincere heart.\n\nIn essence, the story of Adam (AS) in Surah Al-Baqarah emphasizes that humans have the capacity for free will, but also the opportunity to repent and seek forgiveness when they make mistakes. This narrative serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle between good and evil, and the need for constant vigilance and humility in the face of temptation.",

It also shows that humans are capable of making mistakes, but can rectify them by seeking forgiveness and guidance from God.
