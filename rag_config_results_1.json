                "generated_answer": "\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out who Adam (A.S) is based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again carefully.\n\nThe context is from a discussion about a surah, likely from the Quran since terms like \"surah\" and mentions of God are present. The text talks about Adam's arrival on Earth and his appointment as master over it. It mentions that God gave Adam the tools of knowledge to fulfill his mission. There's also a connection made between Adam's story and the subsequent assignment of the Israelites, positioning Adam's account as a link between different sections of the surah.\n\nThe question is asking who Adam (A.S) is according to this context. The answer should be derived solely from the given text. Let me note the key points:\n\n- Adam was appointed as master over Earth, in charge of its affairs under certain conditions.\n- God provided him with knowledge necessary to fulfill his mission.\n- His role is part of a broader context discussing human life and existence, emphasizing God's grace and the purpose of human presence on Earth.\n- The story of Adam serves as an interlude leading into the Israelites' assignment, showing a progression from Adam's stewardship to later covenants.\n\nI should avoid bringing in external knowledge about Adam from other religious sources unless it's explicitly mentioned here. The context doesn't mention his creation story or the Garden of Eden, focusing more on his role as a responsible steward of Earth and the knowledge given by God. The abbreviation A.S might stand for \"Alayhi Assalam\" (peace be upon him), a common Islamic honorific, but the context here is about his role as appointed by God to manage Earth with the tools of knowledge. The answer should highlight his appointment as master, the knowledge given, and his role in the narrative linking to subsequent events with the Israelites.\n</think>\n\nAdam (A.S) is depicted in the context as the one appointed by God as master over the Earth, entrusted with full charge of its affairs under specific conditions.

There's also a mention of the Israelites being depicted as shifty and stubborn, but I'm not sure if that's directly about hypocrites. The conclusion part discusses Islam's stance on justice and not allowing excuses for corruption, which might relate to how hypocrites are dealt with.\n\nThe key points here are the derogatory portrayal of hypocrites, their disobedience, their being exposed, and the comparison to the spider's house.

The surah's treatment is harsh, using strong language to denounce them.\n\nSo putting it all together: The Qur'an describes hypocrites as losers, uses parables like the spider's frail house to illustrate their instability, condemns their disobedience despite hearing the message, exposes their excuses and malevolent attitudes, and strongly denounces their hypocrisy as a form of unbelief.

The text condemns their hypocrisy, exposing their malevolent attitudes toward Islam and the Prophet Muhammad, and dismisses their excuses as baseless.

According to Ibn Kathir's tafsir, when Allah commanded Adam and his wife to avoid the forbidden tree, He gave them the freedom to choose between obedience and disobedience (2:35). This demonstrates that humans have been endowed with free will, allowing them to make decisions that can lead to either righteousness or sin.\n\nHowever, when Adam and his wife disobeyed Allah's command, they immediately felt remorse and turned to Allah in repentance (2:37). This episode illustrates the importance of seeking forgiveness and repentance when one has erred. Allah's acceptance of their repentance (2:37) shows that He is Merciful and Forgiving, always willing to pardon those who turn to Him with a sincere heart.\n\nIn essence, the story of Adam (AS) in Surah Al-Baqarah emphasizes that humans have the capacity for free will, but also the opportunity to repent and seek forgiveness when they make mistakes. This narrative serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle between good and evil, and the need for constant vigilance and humility in the face of temptation.",

I need to base my answer strictly on the provided context. \n\nFirst, looking at the context, it mentions Adam's disregard for his covenant with God by eating the forbidden fruit. That seems to highlight free will because he chose to disobey. The story talks about Satan's deception leading to Adam's error. So free will is there because Adam made a choice, even if influenced by Satan.\n\nThen there's the part about his repentance. The verses 36-39 from Al-Baqarah are cited. It says Adam received certain words from God and his repentance was accepted. The text emphasizes that God is merciful and accepts repentance. So the lesson here is that even after making a mistake, sincere repentance leads to forgiveness. \n\nThe context also mentions that guidance will come from God, and those who follow it have nothing to fear. This suggests that after repentance, people should follow the divine guidance. Additionally, the part about everyone's sins being their own responsibility reinforces personal accountability, which ties back to free will\u2014since each person's choices are their own. \n\nThe text also contrasts those who follow the guidance (and thus can be forgiven) with those who deny the revelations, facing punishment. This underscores the importance of choosing to repent and follow the right path. \n\nI should make sure not to include anything outside the given context. The answer should mention both free will (Adam's choice to disobey) and the availability of repentance leading to forgiveness. Also, the idea that repentance is accessible to all, as the gateway is open without restrictions. \n\nWait, the context also says Adam's repentance was accepted because he realized his mistake and sought forgiveness. So the lesson is that sincere repentance is key. Also, the cycle of human experience\u2014people will make mistakes but can return through repentance. \n\nI need to structure this into clear points. Maybe first free will: humans have the choice to obey or disobey. Then, the necessity and possibility of repentance, showing God's mercy. Also, that each person is responsible for their own sins and can seek forgiveness directly. \n\nThe answer should reference the verses mentioned, like verse 36 where Adam's repentance is accepted, and the part about guidance being provided. Also, the mention that the gateway to repentance is open to all, so it's accessible. \n\nI should avoid mentioning crucifixion or other figures since the context here focuses on Adam's own repentance and God's mercy. The key points are free will leading to both sin and the opportunity to repent, and God's mercy in accepting repentance when sought sincerely.\n</think>\n\nThe story of Adam (AS) teaches that **free will** is central to human experience, as Adam chose to disregard his covenant with God, illustrating humanity's capacity for both obedience and error. His mistake, influenced by Satan\u2019s deception, underscores the reality of personal accountability for one\u2019s actions. However, the narrative also emphasizes **repentance** as a divine mercy: Adam\u2019s sincere plea for forgiveness led to God\u2019s acceptance of his repentance, highlighting that repentance is accessible to all who seek it earnestly. The verses stress that God alone is the \"Accepter of Repentance, the Merciful,\" affirming that forgiveness is guaranteed for those who turn back to Him. Additionally, the story reinforces that every individual bears responsibility for their own sins, and the path to redemption remains open, as \"the gateway to repentance and forgiveness is open to all, without restriction or discrimination.\" This cycle of error, realization, and divine mercy reflects the enduring human struggle and the perpetual availability of God\u2019s compassion.",

The context also states that the accounts of the Israelites are warnings against their evil designs and advises Muslims not to follow their example. \n\nAnother point is that when Muslims deviated from Islam, they faced consequences similar to the Israelites, leading to weakness and humiliation. The Qur'an's stories fit the context to reinforce arguments, emphasizing that these historical accounts are meant to guide Muslims in their current situations. The key idea is that the Qur'an uses these historical lessons to warn Muslims to avoid pitfalls, maintain their leadership, and stay true to God's trust.\n\nI should make sure not to include anything outside the given text. The answer should mention the warnings against repeating the Israelites' mistakes, the consequences of deviation, and the purpose of guiding Muslims through these historical accounts. Also, note that the Qur'an doesn't focus on chronology but on the moral or instructional messages.\n</think>\n\nThe Qur'an uses the history of the Israelites as a warning to Muslims by highlighting their mistakes and negative outcomes to caution against repeating similar errors. It emphasizes the consequences faced by the Israelites, such as humiliation and weakness, when they deviated from divine guidance, persecuted advocates of truth, or succumbed to selfishness. These accounts serve to remind Muslims to avoid pitfalls like following the Israelites' evil designs, abandoning Islamic principles, or failing to uphold their leadership role as stewards of God\u2019s message. The Qur\u2019anic narratives are not chronological but are strategically presented to reinforce lessons relevant to Muslims' present challenges, ensuring they learn from these historical examples to preserve their spiritual and moral integrity.",

It also discusses a test for Adam to face temptation, learn from his actions, take responsibility, identify his enemy, and experience repentance.\n\nSo putting this together, Adam is presented as the first human, appointed by God as a leader on Earth. He's given knowledge and a covenant. The story includes his testing, a mistake he made (maybe the Forbidden Tree?), repentance, and learning responsibility. The context also connects him to the Israelites' assignment later. The term Al-Baqarah (The Cow) is mentioned, which is a surah in the Quran, so this context is likely from the Quran's Surah Al-Baqarah. \n\nThe question is asking \"Who is Adam (A.S)?\" based solely on this text. The answer should highlight his role as God's vicegerent, his appointment as master of Earth, the covenant, his testing and subsequent repentance, and his role as the father of humanity. I should avoid adding any external knowledge beyond the context given. Since the context mentions \"Adam, father of the human race,\" that's important. Also, the testing was part of his training for his task. \n\nI need to make sure not to include anything not in the provided text. For example, the story of Eden or the serpent isn't directly mentioned here, so I shouldn't mention those. Focus on the covenant, his role as vicegerent, the tools of knowledge, the test to face temptation, responsibility, repentance, and his position as the progenitor of humanity. The answer should be concise, using the details from the context provided.\n</think>\n\nAdam (A.S) is portrayed in the context as the first human appointed by God as vicegerent (deputy) on Earth, given the responsibility to govern it \"in full charge of its affairs\" under certain conditions. He was endowed with knowledge to fulfill this mission and is described as the \"father of the human race.\" The context highlights his covenant with God, his brief training\u2014including a test to confront temptation, learn from his actions, and bear responsibility\u2014and his experience of repentance after an error. This process was meant to awaken his inner strengths, identify his challenges, and instill accountability. The narrative positions him as the foundational figure tasked with stewardship over Earth, emphasizing his role in setting the stage for humanity's mission, including the later assignment of the Israelites.",

The text says the tree is a symbol of things forbidden on earth, which are necessary for free will. It also talks about Adam's training and preparation for his task on earth.

The prohibition underscores the need for moral limits, as the context states that such restrictions are essential for free will to exist.

It mentions that the Jews had an established religious heritage and were respected by the Arab tribes of Aws and Khazraj. However, the pagan Arabs weren't eager to convert to Judaism. \n\nThe text also states that Muslims initially thought the Jews would welcome Islam because the Quran endorsed the Torah and the Jews were supposed to await a new Messenger.

But instead, the Jews opposed them. The context also mentions that their opposition has continued, using the same methods. \n\nSo the key points from the context are: the Muslims expected the Jews to accept Islam because of their shared scriptures, but the Jews didn't. The Jews began to wage war against Islam. The context also implies that the Jews' opposition was motivated by stubborn hatred, as mentioned in the part where it says Jewish and Arab opponents are motivated by hatred of Islam. \n\nWait, the first paragraph says \"Jewish and Arab alike, are motivated only by stubborn hatred of Islam.\" But that seems like a general statement. The specific context about the Jews in Madinah is that they opposed Islam despite the Muslims expecting their support.

                "ground_truth": "The story of Adam (AS) in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:35-37) teaches valuable lessons about free will and repentance. According to Ibn Kathir's tafsir, when Allah commanded Adam and his wife to avoid the forbidden tree, He gave them the freedom to choose between obedience and disobedience (2:35). This demonstrates that humans have been endowed with free will, allowing them to make decisions that can lead to either righteousness or sin.\n\nHowever, when Adam and his wife disobeyed Allah's command, they immediately felt remorse and turned to Allah in repentance (2:37). This episode illustrates the importance of seeking forgiveness and repentance when one has erred. Allah's acceptance of their repentance (2:37) shows that He is Merciful and Forgiving, always willing to pardon those who turn to Him with a sincere heart.\n\nIn essence, the story of Adam (AS) in Surah Al-Baqarah emphasizes that humans have the capacity for free will, but also the opportunity to repent and seek forgiveness when they make mistakes.

The test allowed him to face temptation, see consequences, and take responsibility. It also talks about him identifying his enemy, experiencing repentance, and seeking forgiveness. The key points here are the necessity of the test to awaken his inner powers and deal with temptation. \n\nThe forbidden fruit and Satan's deception led Adam to disregard his covenant with God. After realizing his mistake, he repented, which made him sorrowful. The Quranic verses (36-39) mention that Adam received words from God, his repentance was accepted, and there's a reminder that those following God's guidance have nothing to fear. \n\nThe story also emphasizes the cycle of human experience: temptation, error, realization, repentance, and seeking forgiveness. The concept of free will is shown through Adam's choice to disobey, leading to consequences, but also the opportunity to repent. The Islamic view here is clear: repentance is possible, and God is merciful. \n\nSo the lessons are that free will allows humans to choose, leading to potential sin, but repentance is available, showing God's mercy. The story underscores taking responsibility, the necessity of guidance, and the path to redemption through sincere repentance. Also, the cycle of error and repentance is a recurring human experience, highlighting the importance of returning to God after mistakes.\n</think>\n\nThe story of Adam (AS) teaches that free will is essential for human growth, as the test in Paradise allowed Adam to confront temptation, understand the consequences of his actions, and bear responsibility. It illustrates that repentance is a fundamental path to redemption: Adam\u2019s disregard for his covenant with God, followed by his realization, sorrow, and plea for forgiveness, highlights the possibility of returning to God through sincere repentance. The narrative emphasizes that God accepts repentance (as shown in Quran 2:36\u201337), offering mercy and guidance to those who follow His path, while underscoring the lifelong battle between guidance and error.

However, the Israelites repeatedly disobeyed Allah, broke their covenants, and rejected their prophets (2:55-59).\n\nThe Quran warns Muslims not to follow in the footsteps of the Israelites, lest they suffer a similar fate (2:61). It emphasizes the importance of obeying Allah's commands, being grateful for His blessings, and heeding the lessons of history. By recalling the Israelites' mistakes, the Quran cautions Muslims against pride, arrogance, and complacency, encouraging them to remain humble and faithful to their covenant with Allah (2:63-64).",
                "generated_answer": "\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how the Qur'an uses the Israelites' history as a warning for Muslims based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context again carefully.\n\nThe context mentions that the Qur'an warns Muslims against the evil designs of the Israelites and advises them not to follow their example. It says there's a link between Adam as God's vicegerent and the Israelites as custodians of God's message. The Qur'an isn't focused on the chronology of the Israelites' history but instead highlights the lessons from their experiences because God knew Muslims might face similar situations. \n\nThe key points here are that the Qur'an relates the Israelites' history to alert Muslims about potential pitfalls. It mentions that when Muslims deviated from Islam, persecuted advocates of true faith, they faced consequences similar to the Israelites' fate, like weakness and humiliation. The Jews are portrayed as trying to lead Muslims astray, and the detailed accounts in the Qur'an serve as warnings. The surah confronts the Children of Israel in front of Muslims to emphasize these lessons.\n\nSo, putting this together, the answer should state that the Qur'an uses the Israelites' history by highlighting their mistakes and negative outcomes as examples for Muslims to avoid. It serves as a cautionary tale, showing that if Muslims follow similar paths (like deviating from faith, persecuting believers), they'll face the same consequences. Additionally, it warns about the Jews' scheming and the need for Muslims to stay true to their faith to maintain their leadership and trust from God.\n</think>\n\nThe Qur'an uses the Israelites' history as a warning for Muslims by highlighting the mistakes and pitfalls they encountered, such as deviations from divine guidance, persecution of believers, and succumbing to selfishness. It emphasizes that when Muslims abandon Islamic principles or oppress advocates of faith, they risk facing consequences similar to those of the Israelites, such as weakness, humiliation, and loss of leadership. The accounts also serve to alert Muslims to the deceptive schemes of the Jews, urging them to avoid imitation of Israelite misdeeds and remain steadfast in their faith to fulfill their divine trust. The stories are presented as direct lessons for Muslims' present challenges, stressing the importance of learning from these historical examples to prevent repeating their errors.",

According to Ibn Kathir's tafsir, when Allah commanded Adam and his wife to avoid the forbidden tree, He gave them the freedom to choose between obedience and disobedience (2:35). This demonstrates that humans have been endowed with free will, allowing them to make decisions that can lead to either righteousness or sin.\n\nHowever, when Adam and his wife disobeyed Allah's command, they immediately felt remorse and turned to Allah in repentance (2:37). This episode illustrates the importance of seeking forgiveness and repentance when one has erred. Allah's acceptance of their repentance (2:37) shows that He is Merciful and Forgiving, always willing to pardon those who turn to Him with a sincere heart.\n\nIn essence, the story of Adam (AS) in Surah Al-Baqarah emphasizes that humans have the capacity for free will, but also the opportunity to repent and seek forgiveness when they make mistakes.

It refers to Adam as the father of the human race and mentions a covenant where Adam was appointed as God's vicegerent (representative) on earth. The story includes the angels prostrating before Adam except for Iblis (Satan), who disobeyed. Adam was given knowledge and tools to fulfill his mission, and there's mention of him repenting after an error. \n\nThe question is asking specifically who Adam (A.S) is according to this text. The answer should be drawn directly from the context without external information. \n\nFirst, note that \"A.S\" is likely an abbreviation for \"Alayhi Assalam\" (peace be upon him), a common Islamic honorific for prophets. The context here is from the Quranic surah Al-Baqarah. \n\nKey points from the context about Adam:\n- He is the father of the human race.\n- He received a covenant from God to be His vicegerent (deputy) on Earth.\n- The angels prostrated before him as per God's command.\n- He was given knowledge by God to fulfill his mission.\n- He made an error (possibly referring to the incident in Eden) but repented, showing forgiveness and guidance.\n\nThe context doesn't mention details like the Eden story's specifics but focuses on his appointment as a leader on Earth, the angels' prostration (which shows his high status), and his role in carrying God's trust. The answer should compile these points without adding external info like the snake or eating from the forbidden tree unless mentioned here, which they aren't. \n\nThe answer should state that Adam (A.S) is the first human and prophet, appointed by God as vicegerent, honored by the angels' prostration, given knowledge, and showed repentance. The context also contrasts his obedience with Iblis's disobedience, highlighting his righteousness. \n\nI need to make sure the answer is concise, using only the given context.

Adam was endowed with knowledge and tools by God to fulfill his mission, enabling him and his descendants to carry out their role on Earth.

The key points here are that the forbidden tree is a symbol of things forbidden on Earth, and without such prohibitions, there would be no free will. The text says that without forbidden things, humans couldn't be tested on their willpower, and without that, they'd be like animals acting on instinct. The human will is crucial, and those without it are like animals.\n\nSo the question is asking why the forbidden tree is significant. The answer should tie back to the idea of free will and testing human resolve. The forbidden tree represents the need for restrictions to exercise free will. Since the context emphasizes that the tree's prohibition was part of Adam's training and preparation for living on Earth, the significance is about establishing the concept of choice and obedience. It's a test of their willpower, which differentiates humans from animals. Without such a test, they wouldn't have free will, which is essential for their purpose on Earth. The tree's prohibition is a necessary part of their preparation, teaching them to make moral choices and uphold their covenant with God. \n\nI need to make sure I don't add anything outside the context.

I need to make sure I only use the information given here and not any outside knowledge.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the context again to pick up the key points. The text mentions that the Jews were established there with a religious heritage and were respected by the Aws and Khazraj tribes. The pagan Arabs weren't eager to adopt Judaism, but when Islam came, the Jews opposed it. \n\nThe passage says that the author thought the Jews would welcome Islam since the Qur'an endorsed the Torah and the Jews were supposed to be waiting for a new Messenger. However, when Islam arrived, their privileges were threatened. Islam not only endorsed their scriptures but also aimed to unify the community, which divided the Jews. Additionally, the Jews considered themselves God's chosen people, heirs to earlier prophets, and maybe didn't want to submit to Muhammad's prophethood. \n\nSo, possible reasons from the text: their privileged position was at risk because Islam's rise could reduce their status. Also, Islam unifying the community might have disrupted their existing influence. They might have felt their special status as chosen people was being challenged by the new religion. The text also mentions that the Jews had boasted about the coming Messenger to the pagan Arabs, but when it happened (with Muhammad), they didn't accept him, perhaps because they expected someone else or wanted to retain their authority. \n\nWait, the context says the Jews were supposed to await a new Messenger per their Scriptures, but they didn't accept Muhammad. Maybe they didn't recognize him as that Messenger. The author thought they would embrace Islam because of the Qur'an's endorsement of the Torah, but the Jews might have rejected Muhammad's claim, leading to conflict. \n\nAlso, the text mentions that the Muslims were in their infancy, and the Jews tried to undermine them by turning them away from the Quran. The Jews felt safe when Muslims abandoned their source of power (the Quran). So their opposition was to protect their own position and prevent Islam from gaining strength. \n\nPutting it all together, the main reasons from the context are: threat to their privileged status, Islam's unifying efforts which divided existing groups, and their refusal to accept Muhammad as the promised Messenger despite their Scriptures indicating they should. They opposed because their own interests were at risk and they didn't accept his prophethood.\n</think>\n\nThe Jews of Madinah opposed Islam primarily because their privileged social and religious position, established among the Aws and Khazraj tribes, was threatened by Islam's rise.

It talks about free will because Adam had a choice to disobey by eating the forbidden fruit. The story is part of his training, a test to face temptation and learn from consequences. The text says that through his actions, Adam had to bear responsibility, identify his enemy (Satan), and experience repentance. The purpose was to make him feel the need to return to God for help and forgiveness. It also mentions that this cycle (disregarding the covenant, realizing the mistake, sorrow, and seeking forgiveness) is part of human experience. The context emphasizes that God's wisdom and mercy allowed this so humans can be equipped to deal with life's challenges on Earth.\n\nSo for free will: The story shows that Adam had the choice to obey or disobey, which is free will. The test was necessary to awaken his inner powers and let him face temptation, showing that humans have the ability to choose their actions.\n\nFor repentance: After Adam's mistake, he repents, feels sorrow, and seeks forgiveness. This teaches that even after sinning, one can repent and return to God. The story serves as a model for the cycle of human error and repentance.

                "ground_truth": "Surah Al-Baqarah (2:47-61) uses the Israelites' history as a warning for Muslims by highlighting their disobedience, ingratitude, and rebellion against Allah's commands. The Quran reminds Muslims of the favors Allah bestowed upon the Israelites, such as liberating them from Pharaoh's tyranny (2:49-50) and providing them with the Torah (2:53). However, the Israelites repeatedly disobeyed Allah, broke their covenants, and rejected their prophets (2:55-59).\n\nThe Quran warns Muslims not to follow in the footsteps of the Israelites, lest they suffer a similar fate (2:61). It emphasizes the importance of obeying Allah's commands, being grateful for His blessings, and heeding the lessons of history. By recalling the Israelites' mistakes, the Quran cautions Muslims against pride, arrogance, and complacency, encouraging them to remain humble and faithful to their covenant with Allah (2:63-64).",
                "generated_answer": "\n<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out how the Qur'an uses the Israelites' history as a warning for Muslims based on the provided context. Let me start by reading through the context again carefully.\n\nThe context mentions that the Qur'an highlights the lessons from Jewish history because God knows Muslim generations might face similar situations. It says the Qur'an isn't focused on the chronology but on the lessons. The key points are that the Israelites had evil designs, and Muslims should avoid following their example. The text specifically warns against slipping into the same mistakes, like deviating from God's rules, persecuting advocates of true faith, and rejecting new revelations (like those of Jesus and Muhammad). When Muslims did deviate, they became weak and humiliated, similar to the Israelites. The Qur'an emphasizes that by rejecting new revelations, the Israelites didn't accept the truth that corroborates their own teachings, and this is criticized.\n\nSo the answer should mention that the Qur'an uses the Israelites' history to warn Muslims against repeating their mistakes. Specifically, Muslims are told to avoid the Israelites' pitfalls like rejecting new prophets, persecuting believers, and deviating from God's guidance, which led to their weakness. The Qur'an presents these historical accounts as cautionary tales to prevent Muslims from facing the same fate.\n</think>\n\nThe Qur'an uses the Israelites' history as a warning for Muslims by highlighting the mistakes and pitfalls that led to their decline, such as rejecting God\u2019s revelations (e.g., those received by Jesus and Muhammad), persecuting advocates of true faith, and abandoning divine guidance. It emphasizes that when Muslims deviate from Islam\u2019s principles or dismiss new revelations, they risk facing consequences similar to the Israelites, such as weakness, humiliation, and loss of leadership. The accounts serve to urge Muslims to learn from these historical examples, avoid repeating their errors, and remain faithful to God\u2019s message to uphold their spiritual and moral responsibility as vicegerents on Earth.",

                "ground_truth": "Surah Al-Baqarah (2:47-61) uses the Israelites' history as a warning for Muslims by highlighting their disobedience, ingratitude, and rebellion against Allah's commands. The Quran reminds Muslims of the favors Allah bestowed upon the Israelites, such as liberating them from Pharaoh's tyranny (2:49-50) and providing them with the Torah (2:53). However, the Israelites repeatedly disobeyed Allah, broke their covenants, and rejected their prophets (2:55-59).\n\nThe Quran warns Muslims not to follow in the footsteps of the Israelites, lest they suffer a similar fate (2:61). It emphasizes the importance of obeying Allah's commands, being grateful for His blessings, and heeding the lessons of history. By recalling the Israelites' mistakes, the Quran cautions Muslims against pride, arrogance, and complacency, encouraging them to remain humble and faithful to their covenant with Allah (2:63-64).",
